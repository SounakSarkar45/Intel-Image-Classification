The Intel image classification project leveraged the 'adam' optimizer and the 'relu' activation function, resulting in a remarkable 99% accuracy. The 'adam' optimizer effectively optimized the model's weights and biases, while 'relu' activation introduced non-linearity, aiding in feature extraction. The achieved accuracy demonstrates the suitability of this configuration for Intel image classification tasks and showcases the potential of CNNs in achieving high precision in complex image recognition tasks.
